create a Python code to graph the data "LLE_data.csv" stored in: "https://github.com/christianczb/LLE.git" in which the first column is time [t] in secs, the second and third are the output concentration of A and B in the solvent [C_AS, C_BS], and the last 2 columns are the output concentration of A and B in the liquid. Include column names and a legend. Plot all variables in the same figure. Additionally, give me here a short explanation of the trends.

Repeat the previous instruction for "LLE_data2.csv" and provide here a short explanation between both graphs highlighting the differences

For Copilot
